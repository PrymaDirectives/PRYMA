## EXECUTION STATUS
- **Whitepaper Architecture**: Complete structural skeleton
- **Agent Roles**: Corrected per convergent design analysis
- **LINGUA System**: Integrated as high-dimensional semantic compression
- **Solana Integration**: Positioned as cryptographic governance anchor
- **Security Model**: Enhanced with container-first autonomic principles

**NEXT ACTIONS**:
1. Populate section content following mythic/technical hybrid tone
2. Generate ASCII diagrams for each placeholder
3. Implement auto-commit journaling system for collaborative authoring
4. Develop first-phase Rust implementation for cryptographic layer
5. Schedule private testing with Shade adversarial simulation

This structural skeleton maintains PRYMA's core differentiation: not just another governance layer, but a container-first autonomic fleet where mythic framing serves as structural infrastructure rather than cosmetic branding.
