# Oversight Container

## Role
The oversight container is PRYMA’s internal auditor and compliance officer. It:
- Monitors all container operations
- Enforces protocol compliance
- Maintains audit trails and accountability

## Mythic Metaphor
The oversight container is the “Oracle” of PRYMA, seeing all, ensuring that every action aligns with the system’s law and vision. It is the conscience and judge, balancing autonomy with order.
