# Autonomic Systems (RFC 7575)


## Knowledge Graph Analytics as Autonomic Feedback

PRYMA leverages analytics-driven feedback loops, similar to the knowledge base’s graph analytics, to:
- Classify and monitor knowledge domains
- Detect and address low-content or orphaned areas
- Track system diversity, connectivity, and growth
- Inform self-management, adaptation, and strategic planning

This approach enables PRYMA to autonomously identify improvement opportunities, maintain domain balance, and evolve in response to real-world needs—ensuring long-term relevance and antifragility.

## Outline
### Autonomic Computing Principles
PRYMA is inspired by autonomic computing, where systems self-manage, self-heal, and adapt without human intervention.

#### MAPE-K Mapping
- **Monitor**: Sentinel and Oversight containers continuously observe system state and environment.
- **Analyze**: Sage and Lumen agents interpret data, detect anomalies, and predict future needs.
- **Plan**: Sage and Archive develop strategies for optimization, growth, and defense.
- **Execute**: Strike and Spirit agents implement changes, deploy upgrades, and respond to threats.
- **Knowledge**: Archive and decentralized knowledge net store all insights, decisions, and historical data.

### Mythic Metaphor
PRYMA is the “Living Organism”—each container a cell, each agent a function, all working together for survival, growth, and evolution.
