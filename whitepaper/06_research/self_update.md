# Self-Update

## Mechanisms
PRYMA is designed for continuous evolution, with agents and containers autonomously proposing, testing, and deploying upgrades.

### Features
- **Self-Improving Protocols**: Agents audit and enhance their own code and rules.
- **Autonomous Upgrades**: Changes are validated and rolled out via consensus and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Continuous Evolution**: The system adapts to new threats, opportunities, and technologies without downtime.

## Mythic Metaphor
Self-update is the “Phoenix Cycle”—PRYMA is reborn again and again, each time stronger, wiser, and more resilient.
