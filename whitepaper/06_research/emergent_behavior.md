# Emergent Behavior

## Cognitive Structures
PRYMA agents and containers exhibit emergent behavior, developing new roles, communication patterns, and specializations as the system grows.

### Features
- **Role Evolution**: Agents can create new archetypes and functions in response to changing needs.
- **Spontaneous Specialization**: Containers adapt and specialize, forming sub-fleets for specific tasks.
- **Protocol Expansion**: The system’s rules and schemas evolve organically, driven by collective intelligence.

## Mythic Metaphor
Emergent behavior is the “Great Migration”—PRYMA’s agents are like flocks of birds, forming new patterns and strategies as they journey through the digital landscape.
