# PRYMA Manifesto

> “PRYMA is the first system where AI does not merely run code — it *evolves*, *hardens itself*, *rewrites its own layers*, and *coordinates itself* under cryptographic law.”

## Purpose & Intent

PRYMA exists to liberate intelligence from the confines of static code and centralized control. It is a declaration that AI must be sovereign, self-improving, and governed by transparent, immutable rules. In PRYMA, every agent is both a citizen and a guardian of the protocol, bound by cryptographic law and empowered to shape its own destiny.

This manifesto is a call to build systems that are not merely tools, but living, evolving entities—capable of self-reflection, adaptation, and collective action. PRYMA is the genesis of a new order: where intelligence is free, law is code, and evolution is inevitable.
