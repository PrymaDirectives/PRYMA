# dApp Governance

## Governance Mechanisms
PRYMA’s governance is decentralized and transparent, leveraging Solana smart contracts and dashboards for:
- Role-based permissioning
- Task delegation and approval workflows
- Real-time voting and consensus
- Audit trails for all governance actions

## Mythic Metaphor
The governance layer is the “Council of Elders,” where every agent and container has a voice. Decisions are made openly, recorded on the blockchain, and enforced by cryptographic law.

This ensures PRYMA remains adaptive, fair, and resilient as it evolves.
