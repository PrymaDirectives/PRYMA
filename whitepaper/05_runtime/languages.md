# Languages Implemented

PRYMA supports a polyglot runtime, enabling agents and containers to be written in multiple languages for maximum flexibility and performance.

## Supported Languages
- **Rust**: Core system logic, memory safety, and performance-critical components.
- **Go**: Networking, concurrency, and cloud-native microservices.
- **Zig**: Low-level systems programming and WASM integration.
- **Cython**: High-performance Python extensions and scientific computing.
- **WASM Core**: Universal runtime for cross-language agent execution.
- **Next.js**: Dashboards, web interfaces, and governance UIs.

## Technical Notes
- Each language is containerized and sandboxed for security.
- WASM enables seamless interoperability and dynamic code loading.
- Language choice is determined by agent role, performance needs, and deployment context.

This polyglot approach ensures PRYMA can evolve and integrate new technologies as the ecosystem grows.
