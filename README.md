# PRYMA

PRYMA is a conceptual framework for a self-organizing, cryptographically governed AI ecosystem. This repository contains whitepaper drafts and design notes only—no operational code or personal data.

## Canonical Reference

**[framework.md](framework.md)** is the living structural skeleton and single source of truth for PRYMA's architecture, archetypes, and protocols. All documentation, code, and references must align with this document.

## Documentation

- Explore the documentation structure in [docs/](docs/README.md).
- Read the whitepaper sections in [docs/whitepaper](docs/whitepaper/README.md).
- See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for agent archetype overview.
- See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for the data-sanitization policy and contributor guidance.

## Alignment Policy

All contributions, documentation updates, and code changes must validate against [framework.md](framework.md). When submitting PRs or issues, reference the relevant framework sections to ensure consistency.
