# PRYMA

PRYMA is a conceptual framework for a self-organizing, cryptographically governed AI ecosystem. The repository is intentionally minimal and documentation-only, with no operational code or personal data.

- Browse the current docs in [docs/](docs/README.md).
- See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for the data-sanitization policy and contributor guidance.
- Historical materials from earlier explorations are archived externally at https://github.com/Pryma-Tech/PRYMA/tree/copilot/update-autoprompt-functionality.
