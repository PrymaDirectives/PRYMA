# Cryptographic Identity

## Identity System
Each PRYMA container and agent is assigned a decentralized identity, managed via Solana smart contracts. Key features:
- Unique keypairs per container
- All messages are signed and verifiable
- Tamper-proof audit logs for every identity action
- Permissioning and role assignment via smart contracts

## Mythic Metaphor
Cryptographic identity is the “True Name” of each agent and container—immutable, unforgeable, and essential for trust in the PRYMA realm.
