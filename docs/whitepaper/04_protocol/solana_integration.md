# Solana Integration

## Technical Integration
PRYMA leverages Solana for:
- Identity contracts (decentralized, tamper-proof)
- Fast, low-cost message signing and verification
- Immutable audit logs for all container actions

### Protocol Diagram (ASCII)
```
[Container] <--> [Solana Contract] <--> [Ledger]
			|                |               |
	[Sign]         [Verify]         [Record]
```

## Mythic Metaphor
Solana is the “Runestone” of PRYMA, inscribing every action and identity in the immutable stone of the blockchain.
