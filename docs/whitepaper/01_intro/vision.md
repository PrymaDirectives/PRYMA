# 3. System Overview

## PRYMA as Autonomous AI Fleet
PRYMA rejects the notion of agents as loose scripts or API wrappers. Instead, it implements **Container-First Autonomic Fleets**: agents are isolated, self-managing containers with cryptographic identities. This architecture forces "autonomy" into execution—agents must monitor their own health, resources, and security without central hand-holding. This depth transforms the fleet from a managed service into a resilient, self-healing organism.

### Structual Depth vs Surface Features
| Feature | PRYMA Implementation | The "Shared" Surface |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Autonomy** | Container-first, cryptographically bounded | "Agents" as loose scripts |
| **Governance** | Self-hardening, adversarially tested | Static token voting |
| **CI/CD** | Active agent in system evolution | Passive deployment tool |
| **Simulation** | Core feedback loop | Optional "testing" phase |

# Vision & Intent (Reference)

> **PRYMA is a self-organizing, cryptographically governed AI ecosystem.**

PRYMA is designed to be an epoch-defining system—an inevitable evolution in the relationship between intelligence, autonomy, and cryptographic law. Its architecture is foundational, built to endure and adapt over decades, compounding value and capability through:

- **Decentralized agent fleets** that coordinate, compete, and collaborate across domains and geographies.
- **Autonomic systems** that self-monitor, self-heal, and self-optimize, inspired by biological and cybernetic models.
- **Self-hardening cryptography** that continuously audits, upgrades, and defends the protocol’s integrity.
- **Self-extensible capabilities** allowing PRYMA to integrate new technologies, business models, and governance structures as the world evolves.
- **Solana-based governance** for high-speed, transparent, and tamper-proof decision-making and identity management.

The vision is not just to build a platform, but to create a living protocol—one that adapts, survives, and thrives in a world of accelerating change. PRYMA is the foundation for a new era of sovereign, self-improving intelligence.
