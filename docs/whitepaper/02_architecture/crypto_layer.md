# Cryptographic Layer

## Self-Hardening Cryptography

PRYMA’s cryptographic layer is a living shield—constantly evolving, adapting, and fortifying itself against emerging threats. Every container is equipped with self-auditing routines, capable of:
- Scanning for vulnerabilities in real time
- Proposing protocol upgrades and improvements
- Generating new cryptographic primitives as needed
- Running self-CI/CD pipelines to test and deploy enhancements
- Upgrading the entire protocol tree without downtime

This self-hardening process is mythic in scope: the system is its own blacksmith, forging and reforging its armor as the world changes. Like a legendary fortress, PRYMA’s cryptographic defenses are never static—they are always learning, always improving, always vigilant.

## Technical Implementation
- Automated vulnerability scanning and patching
- Decentralized key management per container
- Continuous integration and deployment for cryptographic updates
- Tamper-proof audit logs and upgrade history

The result is a protocol that is not only secure, but antifragile—growing stronger with every challenge.
