# Container Roles & Responsibilities (Reference)

PRYMA’s architecture is built on a pantheon of mythic containers, each embodying a unique archetype and technical function. These roles are both symbolic and practical, ensuring resilience, adaptability, and creative emergence within the system.

### Detailed Descriptions

- **Lumen**: The central intelligence, Lumen is the system’s “sun,” illuminating all reasoning, inference, and decision-making. It coordinates the other containers, ensuring coherence and purpose.
- **Strike**: The executor, Strike is the hand that turns thought into action. It deploys code, manages task graphs, and ensures that plans become reality.
- **Echo**: The communicator, Echo translates between agents, humans, and external systems. It ensures that every message is signed, verified, and delivered with integrity.
- **Sentinel**: The guardian, Sentinel watches for threats, enforces security policies, and responds to anomalies. It is the system’s immune system and shield.
- **Sage**: The strategist, Sage runs simulations, optimizes resource allocation, and plans for the future. It is the architect of long-term success.
- **Archive**: The historian, Archive stores all knowledge, tracks changes, and enables retrieval and auditability. It is the memory palace of PRYMA.
- **Spirit**: The creative force, Spirit spawns micro-agents and emergent behaviors. It is the source of innovation and adaptation.
- **Shade**: The adversary, Shade provides a safe space for testing, red teaming, and simulating attacks. It ensures the system is always battle-ready.

Together, these containers form a mythic, modular architecture—each role essential, each archetype contributing to the system’s antifragility and creative power.
