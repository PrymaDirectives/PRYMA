# Security Hardening

## Strategies

PRYMA’s security is multi-layered, combining technical rigor with mythic archetypes:

- **Sentinel Container**: Acts as the vigilant guardian, monitoring all activity, enforcing security policies, and responding to threats in real time.
- **Tamper-Proof Audit Logs**: Every action is recorded in immutable logs, ensuring transparency and accountability. These logs are cryptographically signed and distributed across the network.
- **Adversarial Sandbox (Shade)**: Provides a safe environment for simulating attacks, running red team exercises, and stress-testing the system. Shade ensures that vulnerabilities are discovered and addressed before they can be exploited.

## Technical and Mythic Metaphors
- Sentinel is the ever-watchful eye, the shield that never sleeps.
- Audit logs are the annals of the realm, preserving every deed for future scrutiny.
- Shade is the shadow adversary, the necessary darkness that reveals the system’s true strength.

Together, these elements create a security posture that is both proactive and resilient—capable of withstanding the evolving threats of a decentralized, adversarial world.
