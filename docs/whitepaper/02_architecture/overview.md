# System Architecture Overview

## Analytics-Driven Feedback Loop

PRYMA’s architecture incorporates a continuous analytics and feedback system inspired by the knowledge base’s domain coverage and connectivity metrics. Each container and agent is instrumented to:
- Track domain diversity and content growth
- Monitor inter-container link structure and orphaned knowledge
- Surface low-content or underutilized domains for targeted expansion
- Provide real-time dashboards for system health, knowledge coverage, and strategic alignment

This ensures the ecosystem remains balanced, relevant, and self-improving over decades, mirroring the knowledge base’s own evolution.
