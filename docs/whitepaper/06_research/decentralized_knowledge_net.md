# Decentralized Knowledge Net

## System Design
PRYMA’s knowledge net is a distributed, resilient system for storing, sharing, and synchronizing information across all agents and containers.

### Features
- **Distributed Embeddings**: Knowledge is encoded as high-dimensional vectors, enabling advanced search and reasoning.
- **Resilient Storage**: Data is replicated and encrypted across the fleet, ensuring availability and privacy.
- **Consensus Graphs**: Agents reach agreement on facts, strategies, and updates via graph-based consensus protocols.

## Mythic Metaphor
The knowledge net is the “Web of Fate”—an ever-expanding tapestry where every thread is a piece of wisdom, and every node is a guardian of truth.
