# PRYMA Whitepaper

This directory contains the PRYMA whitepaper drafts, organized into numbered sections. Each chapter groups related drafts to keep the concepts coherent and easy to navigate.

## Table of Contents

1. **Intro** (`01_intro/`)
   - Vision, manifesto, and mythology of the PRYMA ecosystem.
2. **Architecture** (`02_architecture/`)
   - Core architecture overview, cryptographic layer, container roles, IO bus, Lingua protocol, and security hardening.
3. **Agents** (`03_agents/`)
   - Agent types, IO container, oversight and security containers, personality templates, and logo system.
4. **Protocol** (`04_protocol/`)
   - PRYMA protocol specifics, container interaction, Solana integration, cryptographic identity, and dApp governance.
5. **Runtime** (`05_runtime/`)
   - Runtime considerations including self-hosting, supported languages, WASM specification, CI/CD, and self-training.
6. **Research** (`06_research/`)
   - Research explorations such as emergent behavior, autonomic systems, decentralized knowledge networks, and self-update approaches.
7. **Appendix** (`07_appendix/`)
   - Reference materials including glossary, FAQ, pseudo code, schemas, core axioms and models, and API endpoints.

Each section contains individual Markdown files for the specific topics listed above.
