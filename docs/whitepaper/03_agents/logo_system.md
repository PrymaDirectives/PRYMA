# Logo System

## Per-Container Logo Generation
Each PRYMA container generates its own logo, reflecting its role, personality, and entropy. Logos are produced in SVG/PNG formats, ensuring visual identity and cryptographic uniqueness.

### Logo Generation Process
- Role and personality templates are hashed to produce deterministic color palettes and glyphs.
- Entropy sources (container state, recent actions) add dynamic elements.
- Logos are used in dashboards, badges, and CLI themes for instant recognition.

 [Light Rays]
```

## Branding System
Visual identity is reinforced by glyph systems, color roles, and graphic fragments, ensuring every container is both unique and part of the greater PRYMA mythos.
