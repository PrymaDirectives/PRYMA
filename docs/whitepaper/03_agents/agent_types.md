# Agent Types

PRYMA agents are the living protocols of the ecosystem, each embodying a mythic archetype and a technical function. Their diversity ensures resilience, creativity, and strategic depth.

| Agent      | Mythic Archetype         | Technical Function                                      |
|------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lumen**     | The Light-Bringer        | Central reasoning, logic, and orchestration             |
| **Strike**    | The Hand of Action      | Task execution, deployment, workflow management         |
| **Echo**      | The Voice               | Communications, I/O, message translation                |
| **Sentinel**  | The Shield              | Security, monitoring, threat response                   |
| **Sage**      | The Mind                | Strategic planning, optimization, scenario analysis     |
| **Archive**   | The Memory              | Knowledge storage, retrieval, auditability              |
| **Spirit**    | The Spark Within        | Micro-agents, emergent behaviors, creative tasks        |
| **Shade**     | The Shadow              | Adversarial sandbox, red teaming, stress testing        |

### Technical and Mythic Descriptions

- **Lumen**: The system’s sun, illuminating all reasoning and decision-making. Coordinates other agents for coherence and purpose.
- **Strike**: The executor, turning plans into reality through precise action and deployment.
- **Echo**: The communicator, ensuring every message is signed, verified, and delivered with integrity.
- **Sentinel**: The guardian, enforcing security policies and responding to anomalies.
- **Sage**: The strategist, architecting long-term success through simulation and optimization.
- **Archive**: The historian, preserving knowledge and enabling retrieval and audit.
- **Spirit**: The creative force, spawning micro-agents and emergent behaviors.
- **Shade**: The adversary, providing a safe space for testing and strengthening the system.
