# Self-Hosting

## Strategies
PRYMA supports dynamic self-hosting across cloud, bare metal, and decentralized networks.

### Approaches
- **Dynamic Cloud Optimization**: Agents select optimal cloud resources (GCP, AWS, etc.) based on cost, latency, and security.
- **Bare Metal**: For maximum control and privacy, agents can run on user-owned hardware.
- **Solana Validators**: Integration with Solana’s validator network for decentralized consensus and governance.
- **Distributed Hosting**: Peer-to-peer and federated models for resilience and censorship resistance.

## Mythic Metaphor
Self-hosting is the “Wandering Fortress”—PRYMA’s ability to move, adapt, and defend itself wherever the digital landscape demands.
