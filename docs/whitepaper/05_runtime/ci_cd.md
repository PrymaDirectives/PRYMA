# CI/CD

## Pipeline
PRYMA employs a self-managed CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration, testing, and deployment of protocol upgrades and agent code.

### Features
- Automated build, test, and deploy for all containers and agents
- Security and compliance checks at every stage
- Canary deployments and rollback support
- Integration with Solana for upgrade governance

## Mythic Metaphor
The CI/CD pipeline is the “River of Renewal,” carrying new code from the source to the living system, ensuring only the worthy changes survive.
