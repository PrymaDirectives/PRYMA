# Self-Training

## Mechanisms
PRYMA agents autonomously discover, curate, and learn from new datasets, continuously improving their capabilities.

### Features
- **Autonomous Dataset Discovery**: Agents scan public and private sources for relevant data.
- **Self-Curation**: Data is filtered, labeled, and validated by consensus.
- **Decentralized Knowledge Net**: Knowledge is shared and synchronized across the fleet.
- **Vector Embedding Pipelines**: High-dimensional representations enable advanced reasoning and search.

## Mythic Metaphor
Self-training is the “Endless Library”—PRYMA’s agents are eternal scholars, always seeking, learning, and growing wiser with every cycle.
